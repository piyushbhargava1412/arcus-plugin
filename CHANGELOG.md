## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2025-06-09

### Added

- Initial release of the **agent-forge** plugin, distributed through the
  `krill-afk` marketplace (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`).
- Plugin manifest at `plugins/agent-forge/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (semver
  `version` is the release authority).
- Two orchestrator meta-skills:
  - `afk-skill-router` — the Away-From-Keyboard Spec → Code → Pull Request pipeline.
  - `context-builder-orchestrator` — one-time repository context generation.
- Supporting sub-skills: `spec-finalizer`, `flow-and-scope-discovery`,
  `test-pattern-discovery`, `repository-context-builder`, `context-pack-builder`,
  `implementation-planner`, `test-spec-compiler`, `subagent-task-dispatcher`, `spec-compliance-reviewer`, 
  `code-quality-reviewer`, `pull-request-builder`, `branch-initializer`,
  `copilot-conversation-search`, and the `model-strategy` reference skill.
- `SessionStart` bootstrap hook (`hooks/hooks.json` → `scripts/bootstrap.sh`) that
  stages helper scripts into the target workspace at `.aforge/bin/` and exports
  `AFORGE_HOME` via `.aforge/env`.
- Cross-tool install support for GitHub Copilot CLI, Claude Code, and VS Code; plus
  IntelliJ/JetBrains usage via the Claude Code/CLI terminal path.

### Changed

- Refactored all skills to be plugin-cache safe: intra-skill resources use relative
  `./assets/...` and `./references/...` links, skill-to-skill references use the
  `agent-forge:<skill>` name form, and executed helper scripts resolve through
  `.aforge/bin/` (falling back to `AFORGE_HOME`).
